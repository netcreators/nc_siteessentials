2015-11-30 v1.4.4 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>
	* XmlSitemapController::renderrenderAction() is no longer a non-cacheable controller action.

2015-01-20 v1.3.0 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>
	* On some sites, the site root page is a shortcut to one of its multiple sub-pages. In this case, a sitemap
		was only created for the shortcut target page - it was impossible to have a sitemap of the entire site created.
		This is now fixed:	If the current page is a direct child of the site root page, and the site root page links to
							it, we work from the site root page. Other shortcut scenarios are ignored, as we cannot know
							if we were redirected, since TypoScriptFrontendController::$originalShortcutPage is protected.
	* Removed deprecated loadTCA() calls.
	* Simplified XmlSitemapBaseController::renderAllowedDoktypeArray().
